## The Hero Shortcode

This theme lets you customize the layout with short codes.
This shortcode is called `hero`.
It can include a caption, height, background color and cover image.
If you were doing this on your own site, you'd probably want to compress the
image with `mozjpeg` and maybe scale it down a bit.
{{% /hero %}}

## Flex

You can use the `flex` shortcode to put a few elements side by side.
Here it is being used with a mix of HTML and markdown to display contact
details.

You can also see examples of the `phone`, `email` and `muc` shortcodes in this
section.

<form name="contact" method="POST">
  <p class="hidden"><label>Don’t fill this out if you're human: <input name="honeypot"/></label></p>
  <label for="contactname">Your Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" id="contactname" placeholder="Rubens Barrichello"/>
  <label for="contactemail" >Your Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="contactemail" placeholder="rubens@example.net"/>

## Blog

The theme includes a blog! By default the blog is in the `post` section to
support the Hugo example theme (and lots of other blog themes that use
`post`).
However, since this theme doesn't show the blog on the home page, I like to
rename the section to `blog` by including this in `config.toml`:

```toml
[permalinks]

post = "/blog/:year-:month-:day-:slug/"
```

  And then changing the `url` parameter in the frontmatter for
  `content/post/_index.md`:

```toml
+++
title       = "Blog"
description = "A nice description of our blog."
url         = "/blog"
+++
```

  <a class="button primary center" href="/blog">Example Blog</a>
{{% /hero %}}


## About

This theme is called "Co-op" because it was originally made for [Corner
Garage](https://cornergarage.coop), a cooperative DIY auto garage in Austin, TX.
You can use it too!

If you click the "about" link in the header, you'll see that some nice `:target`
styles are applied to this sections heading.
The color of this chrome (and the color of links and buttons with the `.primary`
class) is set by the CSS variable `--color-accent`.
It is overridden in the example site by overriding the `css.html` partial and
loading a stylesheet that sets the variable on the `:root` element.
You can customize lots of things this way! See the readme for details.
